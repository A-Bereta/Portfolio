## About
The exploratory test for Drogeria Pigment's site was one of the first I performed and it took place during Software Developement Course. Despite the issue I found was not a major one, it gave me a big satisfaction.

The test for Silkfencing's site was related to my hobby, as the shop provides training weapons for Historical European Martial Arts. It was also a part of exercising on my own, outside the course lessons. I found two issues with product description display and notified shop's staff about them.
